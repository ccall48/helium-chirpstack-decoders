SenseCAP S2100 Data Logger can connect to MODBUS-RTU RS485/Analog/GPIO sensors and transmit data from sensors to the LoRaWAN network. Benefits from LoRa and IP66 design, this device features stability and reliability and can cover a long transmission range while keeping ultra-low power consumption, ideal for outdoor use. It is specifically optimized for OTA with built-in Bluetooth, which enables quick setup and update. It can be battery-powered or connected to a 12V external power supply. When the 12V power supply is connected, the replaceable built-in battery is set to be used as the backup power supply. What's more, with the help of S2110 converter, S2100 Data Logger is able to connect to Grove Sensor, it is an ideal solution for developing, fast prototyping, and small deployment for DIY Industrial level LoRaWAN Sensors.
